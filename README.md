##3134 grader

A quick script for testing `SymbolBalance` for 3134.

Runs and compiles every `SymbolBalance.java` on a variable amount of testers, outputting student output into a text file called `results.txt` in each student's respective directory.
#Instructions

- Clone this repo.
- Put **unzipped** student directories in student_solutions
- Put all your test files in the testfiles directory.
	- They have to be named in the structure of `Test1.java`, `Test2.java`, `Test3.java` etc. Needs to start with `Test1.java`. Deviate from this structure and it doesn't work.
- Go to main directory and run `./grade_hw.sh`. 
	-	Make sure the shell script is set as executable through `chmod u+x grade_hw.sh`.
- Done.
