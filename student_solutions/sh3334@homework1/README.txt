Problem 1:
To compile the program, type: javac Problem1.java
To run the program, type: java Problem1
After that, the program states the largest rectangle with its length and width. In this example, of the five hard-coded rectangle sizes, it states, “The largest rectangle is 15 by 6.”

Rectangle:
To compile the program, type: javac Rectangle.java
To run the program, type: java Rectangle
This is used to aid Homework 1 assignment.

Problem 2:
To compile the program, type: javac Problem 2.java
To run the program, type: java Problem2
After that, the program states whether or not the rectangle is in the array. In this example, it shows that rectangle “f” is not in the array. Therefore, it states, “This rectangle is not in this array.”

Problem 3:
To compile the program, type: javac Problem3.java
To run the program, type: java Problem3
After that, the program states the run time for the code fragments: Function A, Function B, and foo. Each code fragments has 5 run times. The progression of timing n increases and it should match the predicted run times: O(N), O(N^2), and O(log N).
