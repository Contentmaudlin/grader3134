Discuss the big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operation for your queue implementation

The big-O running time of the enqueue operation is 1 because you just have to add something to the end of the linked list (we made our stack as a linked list is MyStack.java)

The big-O running time of the dequeue operation is n because you have to move all n elements from one stack to the other.
