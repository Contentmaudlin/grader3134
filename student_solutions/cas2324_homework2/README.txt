I included both a markdown (text) file with my answers `written.md` and a PDF
version as well that might be easiest to view `written.pdf`.


# Programming Problems

## Problem 1

`SymbolBalance.java`, `MyStack.java`, `Test.java` are the files included to
solve this problem.  To run against the test file `Test.java`, the commands
should be:

```sh
javac SymbolBalance.java
javac MyStack.java
java SymbolBalance Test.java
```

The program should throw a Runtime Error with the output:

`Unbalanced Error Type 1! { has no closing symbol.`

I didn't use the stack for comments or strings and handled those separately via
variables and some if/else logic.  Not sure it's the best way but seems to work
alright.


## Problem 2

`MyQueue.java`, `MyStack.java`, `Program2.java`, `TwoStackQueue.java` are all
needed for this problem.  `Program2.txt` is also included to answer the written
portion.

To run:

```sh
javac MyStack.java
javac MyQueue.java
javac TwoStackQueue.java
javac Program2.java
java Program2
```

Expected output is:
1
2
3

Think that's it, thanks!
