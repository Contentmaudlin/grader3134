Big-O of enqueue and dequeue for TwoStackQueue.java 

Enqueue: 
My implementation of enqueue consists of one line: stack1.push(x). 
My implementation of the stack in MyStack is based on a LinkedList, therefore this operation is O(1). 

Dequeue: 
The bulk of my dequeue method is contained within an if statement. This is obviously the worst case run time, so the statements within this if will be considered. The first, if (stack1.isEmpty()) {return null;} is constant time. The second is while (!stack1.isEmpty()) {stack2.push(stack1.pop());}. Since push and pop are both O(1), this loop is also O(1). Therefore, dequeue is overall O(1).
