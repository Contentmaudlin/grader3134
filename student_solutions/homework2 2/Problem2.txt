The big-oh running time of the enqueue is O(1) because it just pushes an element into stack 1.
The big-oh running time of the dequeue is O(1) if the stack 2 is not empty since it just needs to pop the top element, 
and it is O(n) if the stack 2 is empty since it needs to push every element in stack 1.
