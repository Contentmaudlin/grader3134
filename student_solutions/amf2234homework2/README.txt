My name is Aaron Friedman. My uni is amf2234. To compile my programs, simply type javac plus the name of the java file (including .java) into the command line. To run SymbolBalancer with my Test file, both it and the MyStack java file must already be compiled. Then type the following into the command line: java SymbolBalancer Test.javaTo run Program2, both it and the TwoStackQueue java file must already be compiled. Then type the following into the command line: java Program2I did not really deviate from any of the instructions. Thanks!
