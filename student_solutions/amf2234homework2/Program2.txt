The enqueue operation runtime is O(1). All that it consists of is pushing an element to a stack (which in this case is adding an element to a linked list). So, while iterating over to that element might be O(n), the actual enqueue operation is O(1).
The dequeue operation runtime is O(n). In the worst case scenario, n elements have been pushed to S1, but no elements have yet been pushed to S2. Thus, when the dequeue operation is called, all of the elements in S1 must be popped (an order 1 operation on n elements makes that order n) and then pushed to S2 (another order 1 operation on n elements). Thus, popping n elements from S1 is order n and then pushing those elements to S2 is order n, so doing both is order 2n. Finally, an element must be popped from S2, an order 1 operation. Therefore, the total cost of the dequeue operation in the worst case scenario is 2n+1, which is O(n).
