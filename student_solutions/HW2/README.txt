MyQueue.java:
--> not to be run on its own.  It is just the queue interface provided to us, implemented in TwoStackQueue.


MyStack.java:
--> also not to be run on its own.  No main() function; just a stack implementation that can be instantiated in another program.


Program2.java:
javac Program2.java
java Program2
--> prints out the results of the main() function, which is testing TwoStackQueue by enqueuing and dequeuing items and printing them out.  Change the main() function to do a different test.


Program2.txt:
--> discussion of the big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operation for TwoStackQueue.


SymbolBalance.java:
javac SymbolBalance.java
java SymbolBalance <filename>
--> returns "Balanced!" if all parentheses and brackets and block comments in the given file are balanced.  If they are not balanced, then it prints "Unbalanced!" and states which symbol is not balanced correctly.


Test.java: 
--> not to be run; it will not compile!  This is a java file I wrote in order to test SymbolBalance.  The parentheses are unbalanced, so it will not compile.


TwoStackQueue.java:
--> not to be run; no main() function.  This is my implementation of a queue using two stacks, and it can be instantiated in another program.


written.txt: 
--> answers to written portion of the assignment.
