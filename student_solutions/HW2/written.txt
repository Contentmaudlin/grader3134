QUESTION 1

public static void printLots(int[] L, int[] P){
	for(int i : P){
		if (i < L.length){
			System.out.println(L[i]);
		}
	}
}




QUESTION 2

parameters given: Lists list1 and list2, want to find intersection of these two lists
return type: List

List<T> result = new ArrayList<T>();
for (T elem : list1){
	if (list2.contains(elem) && !result.contains(elem))
		result.add(elem);
}
return result;




QUESTION 3

two stacks in one array: stack1 starts from index 0; the leftmost element.  stack2 starts from index n-1; the rightmost element.  The two stacks grow and shrink from the middle.
methods used to implement two stacks in one array:

instance variables:
int size, top1, top2
T[] stacks = (T[]) new Object[100];

void push_stack1(T num){
	if (top1 < top2 - 1){
		top1++; // increase size of stack1
		stacks[top1] = num; // add num onto the end of stack1
	}else{
		overflow, error!
	}
}

void push_stack2(T num){
	if (top2 > top1 + 1){
		top2—-; // increase size of stack2
		stacks[top2] = num; // add num onto the end of stack2
	}else{
		overflow, error!
	}
}

T pop_stack1(){
	if (top1 >= 0){
		int last = arr[top1];
		top1—-;
		return last;
	}else{
		nothing to pop!
	}
	return 0;
}

T pop_stack2(){
	if (top2 <= size - 1){
		int last = arr[top2];
		top2++;
		return last;
	}else{
		nothing to pop!
	}
	return 0;
}





QUESTION 4

(a)
Move car 4 from the input track to S_1.
Move car 3 from the input track to S_1.
Move car 1 from the input track to the output track.
Move car 8 from the input track to S_2.
Move car 2 from the input track to the output track.
Move car 3 from S_1 to the output track.
Move car 4 from S_1 to the output track.
Move car 7 from the input track to S_2.
Move car 6 from the input track to S_2.
Move car 9 from the input track to S_1.
Move car 5 from the input track to the output track.
Move car 6 from S_2 to the output track.
Move car 7 from S_2 to the output track.
Move car 8 from S_2 to the output track.
Move car 9 from S_1 to the output track.

(b)
Note that since cars cannot be moved between holding tracks, and from a holding track a car can only go to the back of the output track, it is impossible to complete a rearrangement if, within a holding track, car number ever increases from bottom to top.  This would force the car with a higher number to go on the output track first, making the rearrangement invalid.  Now consider the 	cars on the input track in the following order: 1, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.
