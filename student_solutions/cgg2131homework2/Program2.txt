Data Structures - Homework 2

Enqueue - the time complexity of the enqueue operation will be O(1).  Because the stacks
that form the queue are implemented using a LinkedList, which in Java is by default a
doubly linked list, the time complexity of adding or removing a single element from the
stacks is O(1).

Dequeue - the time complexity of the dequeue operation will be O(N).  The dequeue
operation checks if the output stack is empty and, if it is, repeatedly pops an element from
the input stack and pushes it to the output stack until there are no more elements remaining
in the input stack, then finally returns a pop from the output stack.  Given this logic, dequeue
will be an operation with a time cost of O(N).
