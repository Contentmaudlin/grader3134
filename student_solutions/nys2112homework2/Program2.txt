Programming 2


The enqueue operation is O(1) — it involves a single call to MyStack’s push method, which in turn 
calls the addFirst method of Java’s LinkedList class. addFirst adds an element to the front of a 
linked list; this process requires a constant number of rearrangements in the “next”/“previous” links 
of the head node & new node, implying O(1).

The dequeue operation is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue at the time of the call. 
When dequeue is called, the elements in S1 are popped — like push, each pop is O(1), and n pops occur, 
giving n operations. These elements are then pushed (O(1)) onto S2, requiring another n operations, or 
a total of 2n so far. Next, the top element is popped from S2, giving 2n + 1. Finally, the remaining 
(n-1) elements on S2 are popped, then pushed onto S1 in 2(n-1) operations. The final total is:
2n + 1 + 2(n-1) = 2n + 1 + 2n - 2 = 4n - 1 operations, or O(n).
