Runtime Discussion for TwoStackQueue:

Enqueue: O(n)
Enqueue operations should all be of linear runtime in proportion to the input size, or O(n). This is because to add each element in n to the queue, they must simply be pushed onto stack 1. Pushing onto stack 1 is adding to the end of a doubly-linked list (as dictated by the methods in the MyStack class), which is an order 1 operation for each element, or and order n operation overall. 

Dequeue: 0(n)
This is an interesting one. The best case runtime for a single dequeue operation is order 1, as an element just has to be popped of stack 2. The worst case run time for a SINGLE dequeue operation is O(n), in the case that one has already enqueued n elements and then wants to dequeue 1 element. This is because all n elements must be popped from stack 1 and pushed onto stack 2. However, I believe the worst case OVERALL time complexity for a dequeue operation is still O(n), because for any n elements that are dequeued, the transfer between stacks will only need to happen once for each element of n, and popping from the second stack is always a O(1) operation for each element of n.
