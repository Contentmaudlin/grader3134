Purpose: To discuss the big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operation for TwoStackQueue.java
===================

public void enqueue(AnyType x)
—————————————————————————————
Big-O for this operation is O(1) since all we’re doing is simply pushing the element x into S1, and from MyStack.java, push() is O(1) operation because we’re simply adding the element to the last place in a doubly-linked LinkedList. 

public AnyType dequeue()
———————————————————————
There are two cases of Big-O operation for dequeue(). If the stack S2 is not empty, we must pop the element from S2 without moving the elements from S1. So the Big-O operation is O(1). If the stack S2 is empty, we use the while loop to push all the elements popped from S1 into S2, then we pop from S2 to dequeue. In this case, Big-O is O(N). So the Big-O of dequeue() operation depends on whether S2 is empty or not.
