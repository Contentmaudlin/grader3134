Enqueue: O(1)
Enqueue just pushes the item to be enqueued onto the top of s1.

Dequeue: O(N)
Dequeue takes everything off the s1 and piles it (backwards) onto the s2. That
requires N operations. It then pops off the top of s2, which is a single operation. Finally, it replaces everything else back onto s1, which requires another N - 1
operations. All in all, dequeuing something takes O(2N) operations, or O(N)
operations. It acts somewhat like a slinky!
