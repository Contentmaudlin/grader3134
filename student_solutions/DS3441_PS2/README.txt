\f0\fs30 \cf0 1. Name: Dengyuan Shi\
2. UNI: DS3441\
3. Programming 1: For the SymbolBalance class, the main method takes args[0], or the first string in the command arguments, to be the filename. \
Programming 2: For the TwoStackQueue class, there is no exception thrown. Therefore, if trying to print out c.dequeue() when stack2 is empty, there would be a NoSuchElementException. \
4. Programming 1: For the error when there is a mismatch, my program prints out the latter character instead of the former one. Therefore, for example, for Test1 class, it says it should be there is a mismatch for [, but my program prints out that there is a mismatch for ). \
