Problem Solving

1). SymbolBalance.java, MyStack.java and Test.java together check if the symbols in the Test.java file are balanced. It will return Unbalanced! Symbol x is mismatched, if symbol x is mismatched. 

2). MyStack.java, TwoStackQueue.java, MyQueue.java, and Program2.java together build a queue by using two stacks. We can use dequeue and enqueue methods to add elements and remove elements under FIFO principle.


Compile and Run

1). Compile MyStack.java first by typing javac MyStack.java into Terminal, and then compile SymbolBalance.java by typing javac SymbolBalance.java into Terminal. Finally, run SymbolBalance.java by typing java SymbolBalance Test.java into Terminal, and Test.java is just the file you want to check.

2). Compile MyStack.java first by typing javac MyStack.java into Terminal. Compile MyQueue.java in Terminal by typing javac MyQueue.java into Terminal, and then compile TwoStackQueue.java by typing javac TwoStackQueue.java into Terminal. Finally, compile Program2.java in Terminal by typing javac Program2.java into Terminal, and run Problem2 by typing java Program2 into Terminal.
