Enqueue:
O(1): Adding an element simply pushes that element to the front of the stack. In a LinkedList implementation of the
Stack, this operation can be done in constant time by simply switching pointers around

Dequeue:
O(n) - in worst case
O(1) - in best case

O(n) - if stack2, the output stack, is empty, then every element from stack1, the input stack, must first be popped and
pushed onto the output stack. This operation takes constant time for every element of stack1, hence O(n)

O(1) - if the stack2 is not empty, then the dequeue operation simply involves popping the top of element of stack2
- which can be accomplished in constant time.
