Program2 runtimes:
	* Enqueue: Enqueue always just pushes the addition to the enqueue
	  stack (S1). This takes O(1) time, because adding to a stack 
	  composed of a doubly linked list will always be in constant time.
	* Dequeue: dequeue is more complex. In most cases, it will also run
	  in constant time, as popping off a stack composed of a linked list
	  will run in constant time. However, in the case where the dequeue
	  stack is empty, it will take O(n) time, because it will need to 
	  pop everything off of S1 and push it to S2. In fact it takes 2n 
	  time (one per pop and one per push) but this simplifies to O(n).
	  as such, in the WORST CASE, it runs in O(n) time.
