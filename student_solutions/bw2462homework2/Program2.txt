\f0\fs24 \cf0 The big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operation:\
\
The big-O running time of enqueue is 1, because it\'92s a simple operation of pushing (adding an element in the end through usage of the linked list).\
\
The big-O running time of dequeue is n. We can see that there are two possible scenarios: when S2 is not empty and when S2 is empty. We should consider the worse/more expensive case out of the two, and that\'92s when S2 is empty. We then need to check if S1 is empty. When S1 is not empty, then we need to pop all the elements from S1 and push them onto S2. This costs n. Lastly we return the first element on S2. There are lots of one-time operations in dequeuing, but they are insignificant when compared to n. Therefore, he big-O running time of dequeue is n. }
