Homework 2 - Data Structures - Section 1 

Problem 1: 

// this class takes in two lists, P and L and prints 
public class printLots {
	public static <AnyType> void printLots (List<AnyType> l, List<AnyType> p){
		Iterator<AnyType> itel = l.iterator();
		Iterator<AnyType> itep = p.iterator();
		
		int i = -1;
		// Iterate through list P
		while (itep.hasNext()){
			int temp = (Integer) itep.next();
			// Iterate through list L 
			while (itel.hasNext()){
				i++;
				if (temp == i){ 
					// Print the element of list l in the position
					// indicated by lost p 
					System.out.println(itel.next());
					break;
				}
				else {
					itel.next();
				}
			}	
		}

	}
}			

Problem 2: Problem 3.4 
//This method takes in two lists are returns the intersection of the two lists 
public static <AnyType> List<AnyType> intersection  (List<AnyType> l1, List<AnyType> l2){
	Iterator<AnyType> itel1 = l1.iterator();
	Iterator<AnyType> itel2 = l2.iterator();
		
	LinkedList<AnyType> lst= new LinkedList<AnyType>();
	// Iterate through second list 	
	while (itel2.hasNext()){
		AnyType temp = itel2.next();
		// Iterate through first list 		
		while (itel1.hasNext()){
			// If an element in the second list is = to one in the first list
			// add it to the intersection list 	
			if (temp == itel1.next()){ 
					
				lst.add(temp);
				break;
			}
				
			else {
				itel1.next();
			}
		}	
	}
	// return the intersection list 
	return lst;
}

Problem 3: 

This pseudocode implements two stacks using only one array. My stack routines declares an overflow when there is not enough space in the array 

public class TwoStacks {
	
	// Instance variables 
	private int leftpointer; 
	private int rightpointer; 
	private int size; 
	
	// Constructor 
	TwoStakcs(int length){
		// Create an empty generic array 
		<AnyType> twoStacks[] = new <AnyType> [length];
		
		// Set the size of the stack to length and 
		// have to pointers to point the beginning and end of the array 
		size = length; 
		leftPointer = -1; 
		rightPointer = size;
	}
	
	// method that checks if the array has enough space 
	private boolean enoughSpace (){
		
		return twoStacks.length > leftPointer + rightPointer; 
	}
	// Method that pushes elements to the right 
	pushRight (<AnyType> element) throws Exception{
		if (enoughSpace()){
			rightpointer --;
			twoStacks[rightPointer] = element; 
			
		}
		else { 
			throw new Exception();
		}
	}
	// Method that pushes elements to the left 
	pushLeft (<AnyType> element) throws Exception{
		if (enoughSpace()){
			leftPointer ++;
			twoStacks[leftPointer] = element; 
			
		}
		else { 
			throw new Exception();
		}
	}

	// Method that pops elements at the left 
	popLeft() throws Exception {
	    if (leftPointer < 0) {
	      throw new Exception();
	    } else {
	      return twoStacks[leftPointer];
	      leftPointer--;
	    }
	  }
	// Method that pops elements at the right 
	popRight() throws Exception {
	    if (rightPointer > size) {
	      throw new Exception();
	    } 
	    else {
	      return twoStacks[leftPointer];
	      rightPointer++;
	    }
	 }
}


Problem 4: 


Sequence: 


1) Move all the tracks that contain integers greater than 1 in the holding tracks, without ever placing a train car with a larger integer on top of a car train with a smaller integer. When the car holds a larger integer than the one found on top of the holding track, go to the next holding track 
2)Push the train car containing 1 in the output track 
3)Push the train cars remaining from the input track to the holding track, without ever placing a train car with a larger integer on top of a car train with a smaller integer. When the car holds a larger integer than the one found on top of the holding track, go to the next holding track. 
4) Push the train cars in the holding tracks to the output track starting from the left holding track to the right most holding track(from the smallest integer to the largest integer). 

Solution with the following train cars:  5-9-6-7-2-8-1-3-4: 
1) Place 4 and then 3 on holding track S1
2) Put 1 in the output track 
3) Place 8 in the holding track S2
4) Place 2 in the holding track S1
5) Place 7,6 in the holding track S2
6) Place 9 in the holding track S3
7) Place 5 in the holding track S2
8) Push the cars in the holding track to the output track in the order: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

A train sequence that wouldn’t work: 

2-1-9-8-7-6-5-4-3   Because it would require more holding tracks since the subsequent car trains from right to left hold integers subsequently larger.
