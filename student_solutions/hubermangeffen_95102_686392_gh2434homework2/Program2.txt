2c) Discuss big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operations:

Enqueue:

This is order 1. It requires only pushing on to the stack. 

Dequeue:

This is of order n. Every time all of the elements are moved over to the second stack, this happens n times within the while loop. The second while loop, returning the elements back on to the first stack, is also order n. So 2n will just be big O(n).
