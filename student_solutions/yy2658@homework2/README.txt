I'm submitting the following files:
MyStack.java - constructs a stack from a list
SymbolBalance.java - for Problem 1
Test.java - for testing the symbol balance
TwoStackQueue.java -for Problem 2
Program2.java - tests the two stack queue


Compile all files together (javac *) because mystack is used by other methods, and then run them as you wish. 

There isn't anything different from the instructions in the submission.
