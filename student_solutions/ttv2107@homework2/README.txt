Homework 2
October 7th, 2016

I'm submitting the following files:
1. MyStack.java -- This file implements the MyStack class. This file should be 
compiled first out of all the files.
2. SymbolBalance.java -- This file solves Problem 1 in the programming 
assignment. This file has to be compiled after MyStack.java.
3. Test.java -- This file is a test file for SymbolBalance.java. This file 
does not need to be compiled. Compile MyStack.java and SymbolBalance.java 
before running this file, then run the command "java SymbolBalance Test.java" 
in the terminal.
4. MyQueue.java -- This file is an interface for the queue abstract data 
type. 
5. TwoStackQueue.java -- This file is an implementation of the queue abstract
data type using stacks. It implements the MyQueue interface. Compile 
MyStack.java and MyQueue.java before compiling this file.
6. Program2.java -- This file is a tester for the TwoStackQueue class. Compile
TwoStackQueue.java (and hence MyStack.java and MyQueue.java) before compiling
this file and then just run this file with the command "java Program2" in 
the terminal.
7. Program2.txt -- This file discusses the running time of the enqueue and 
dequeue operaiton for the TwoStackQueue class. Does not need to be compiled. 
8. written.txt -- This file is for the written assignment. Does not need to be
compiled.

In summary, the order of compiling and running files should be:
1. Compile MyStack.java first.

2. For Problem 1:
    (a) Compile SymbolBalance.java
    (b) Run the command "java SymbolBalance Test.java" in the terminal

3. For Problem 2:
    (a) Compile MyQueue.java
    (b) Compile TwoStackQueue.java
    (c) Compile Program2.java
    (d) Run the command "java Program2" in the terminal
