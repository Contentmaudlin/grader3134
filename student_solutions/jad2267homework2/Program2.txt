"In a file called Program2.txt, discuss the big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operation for your queue implementation."

The running time of my enqueue and dequeue operations are O(n). To enqueue or dequeue items, in the worst-case analysis my program always moves every item that has been put in the queue from one stack to the other stack. This requires 2 operations per item -- pop then push -- but we drop the constant 2 and the running time is O(n).
