Run times:


enqueue:
O(1) because my MyStack class uses the removeFirst() method of the LinkedList which always has a run time of O(1) because it removes the first element of the list.


dequeue:
O(n*n) because in the worst case scenario, stack2 will take n time to be filled up if it is empty. Then, there is a pop statement that always must be returned which has a run time of n as well. Thus, the run time is O(n squared).
