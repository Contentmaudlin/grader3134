To compile + run my code run the commands in the terminal window:
- javac SymbolBalance.java
- java SymbolBalance Test.java
	-Test.java can be replaced by any tester.

- javac Program2.java
- java Program.java



Things to be aware of:
-Problem 1 uses a stack of data type String so that I could account for the /* exceptions.
-Problem 1 also tries to handle the special case of quotations with an integer variable. 

-Problem 2 works as expected. It also has a toString method which I was using to check for errors.
