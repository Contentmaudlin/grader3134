1. SymbolBalance.java

Code runs as expected, tested on with Test1-6. Returns the corresponding closed symbol if unbalanced or mismatched, if stack is not empty after running through the entire file, then returns “not closed”. For MyStack, I created my own pop, top, push, isEmpty, size methods. 
The java files need to be compiled:
javac SymbolBalance.java
javac MyStack.java

Running instructions (take java file as argument)
java SymbolBalance Test.java


2. TwoStackQueue.java

Code runs as expected, tested with TwoStackQueueTester.java and Problem2.java. Implements MyQueue.
The java files need to be compiled:
javac TwoStackQueue.java
javac Problem2.java
javac TwoStackQueueTester.java
