Discuss the big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operation for your queue implementation

Big-o running time of my enqueue is O(1) since it is just .push(x).
My dequeue is O(N) because if stack 2 is empty, then the method copies stack 1 elements over to stack 2 by popping and pushing, in order to pop from it. So the act of copying it over makes it O(N)
