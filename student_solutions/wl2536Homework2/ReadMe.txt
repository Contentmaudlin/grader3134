Problem: Symbol Balance & Two Stack Queue

1. Symbol Balance
This program is designed to check whether the symbol is correct in the java file taken as a command line argument. And I have made a sample stack to check the functionality of this program. Then the error case is output by another file.


2. Two Stack Queue

A. The Two Stack Queue program is a class designed to make a queue by two stacks and it can support the main function of a queue.I designed my program by adjusting the order of the stack and the queue, making them oppositely function and then move stackpush to stackpop.

B. In a custom Program2 class, the TwoStackQueue is tested. And I test some random figures to verify the functionality of the StackQueue main method. The values are returned and printed in the order that they were enqueued and prints it.
