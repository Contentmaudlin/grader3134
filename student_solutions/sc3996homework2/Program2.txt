Big-O running time analysis
1. enqueue:
stack1.push(i)//constant
Hence its running time is constant, so the big-O of it is O(1)

2. dequeue:
if (isEmpty()) {
 throw new NoSuchElementException (blabla); //constant
}
else if (stack2.isEmpty()) { 
 moveStack1ToStack2(); //n: size of stack1
}
return stack2.pop(); //constant
Hence its running time is O(n), in which n refers to the size of stack1
