 Discuss the big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operation for TwoStackQueue:

ENQUEUE:
The enqueue(T x) method calls the push(T x) method from the MyStack class.
This method in MyStack uses the LinkedList method addLast(T item), which adds an item
to the back of the linked list in O(1) time, because the LinkedList class in java
assumes doubly linked list behavior so it can access the back of the list in constant time.
This makes the enqueue method run in O(1).

DEQUEUE:
If the second stack is empty, the dequeue() method will move everything
from the first stack to the second. The top item from the second stack will then
be dequeued using a call to the pop() method from MyStack. Like the push() method,
this method runs in O(1) time because it takes constant time to access the back of
the LinkedList (and remove that item).
However, if the second stack if empty when the dequeue() method is called,
the first stack needs to be iterated through in order to pop items off the first stack
and push them onto the second. If N is the number of items that need to be move from
the first stack to the second, the dequeue() method on average will run in O(N) time.
