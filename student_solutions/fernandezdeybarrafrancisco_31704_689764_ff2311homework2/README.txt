For Part 1, I created a MyStack class, a SymbolBalance class and a Test class. In order for them to work the MyStack class has to be compiled first, the SymbolBalance class second and the Test class third. My program worked for all the Test methods provided. I used arrayLists for the stacks. To test the class you simply type the name of the Test file in the command line arguments.

For Part 2, I created a TwoStackQueue class using which uses the MyStack from the previous method. Therefore the MyStack has to be compiled first in order to work in addition the MyQueue interface needs to be compiled as well since TwoStackQueue implements the interface. The program worked with the Test files proved. In order to run the test file you run theTwoStackQueue method with the testFile as a command line argument.
