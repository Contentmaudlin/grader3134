Homework 2
Kelly Ryu (hr2362)


In my queue implementation, when the current size of the queue returned by the size() method is n, the enqueue operation is O(n) while the dequeue operation is O(1). 

This is because the data is always stored in stack2, which stores the data in the first-in-first-out order, as a queue should. For the enqueue operation, all of this data is passed to stack1 so that first-in is the last-out. Then, the element is added without disrupting this order, and the (n+1) elements are then passed back to stack2. Thus, a total of 2n+1 operations are made, so the run-time is O(n). 

For the dequeue operation, one element is popped from stack2 in a first-in-first-out way. Thus the runtime is O(1).
