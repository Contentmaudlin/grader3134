                    Big-O Run Times of Enqueue and Dequeue

*Enqueue:
    - When enqueue is called, a conditional is immediately run.
    - The conditional must determine whether or not Stack 2 is Empty, which is a constant time operation
    - Based upon the result of the expression (whether or not Stack 2 is Empty), the conditional will either:
        a) Push the argument to the top of Stack1, a constant time operation
        b) Use a while loop to push each popped value of Stack 2 into Stack 1
    - Clearly, path b is the more intensive route, so its run time should be evaluated
    - Inside the while loop, the top value in stack 2 is popped (constant time operation) and then that value is
      pushed to the top of stack 1 (also a constant time operation)
    - This process inside of the while loop will be repeated for the length, n,  of the while loop, thus making the
    total run time of the while loop O(n).
    - Therefore, the Big O run time of the conditional is also O(n) and the run time of the enqueue method in total is
    O(n)

*Dequeue:
    - The dequeue method's run time analysis follows almost the exact same trajectory as that of the enqueue method
    - When dequeue is called, a conditional is immediately run.
        -This first conditional must determine whether or not the queue is empty, which is a constant time operation
    - The more time intensive result of the conditional is the "else" portion of the conditional, as it runs another
     conditional, while the "then" portion simply prints an error message (constant time)
        - The next conditional must determine whether or not Stack 1 is Empty, which is a constant time operation
        - Based upon the result of the expression (whether or not Stack 1 is Empty), the conditional will either:
            a) pop the top of Stack2, a constant time operation
            b) Use a while loop to push each popped value of Stack 1 into Stack 2
        - Clearly, path b is the more intensive route, so its run time should be evaluated
        - Inside the while loop, the top value in stack 1 is popped (constant time operation) and then that value is
          pushed to the top of stack 2 (also a constant time operation)
        - This process inside of the while loop will be repeated for the length, n,  of the while loop, thus making the
        total run time of the while loop O(n).
        - Therefore, the Big O run time of the conditional is also O(n) and the run time of the dequeue method in total is
        O(n)

*Therefore, both the enqueue and dequeue methods for the Two Stack Queue are O(n) operations
