\f0\fs24 \cf0 The enqueue function\'92s Big-Oh Analysis is O(1) because it\'92s just a simple push to the first stack. \
\
The worst case for dequeue function will be O(n). The worst case happens only when the second stack is empty. When the second stack is empty, we need to copy everything from the first stack to the second stack which is O(n) operation. But in better cases, if the second stack contains items, then the dequeue function has the runtime O(1).}
