I think the way I implemented the queue is not the most efficient way, but I couldn't think of a better way to do it. 

First enqueue: 
	Order 1.
		each successive enqueue: Order 1.

Dequeue:
	n + 1 (where n is the number of items in stack 1.)
	All items from stack 1 are moved to stack 2 for dequeueing process.
		each successive dequeue: Order 1.

Enqueue right after dequeue:
	n + 1
	All items from dequeue stack (stack 2) are moved to stack 1 for dequeuing process.
		each successive enqueue: Order 1. 

Worst case Enqueue time: N (where N is the number of items in the queue.)
Worst case Dequeue time: N (where N is the number of items in the queue.)

Best case Enqueue time: 1
Best case Dequeue time: 1
