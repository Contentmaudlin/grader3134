Instructions on Compiling and running:

to compile the first program, in terminal, do

	>> javac SymbolBalance.java

Note: this gives a recommendation to do -Xlint to fix warnings, but when I do -Xlint, the warnings go away. So I couldn't catch the "unchecked or unsafe operations."

To run the first program, do

	>> java SymbolBalance <Name of the test file>

for example, to run my test.java file, do

	>> java SymbolBalance test.java



To compile the second program, do

	>> javac TwoStackQueue.java

This file does not have a main method so compile the driver file by doing 

	>> javac Program2.java

To run it, do

	>> java Program2
