The files I am submitting are:

MyQueue.java
MyStack.java
Test.java
SymbolBalance.java
TwoStackQueue.java
Problem2.java

For programming assignment #1, I created:
- SymbolBalance.java, MyStack.java, and Test.java

To test #1, compile the programs from the command line
and then run with the java command:
- javac SymbolBalance.java (compiles SymbolBalance and MyStack)
- java SymbolBalance Test.java (runs the program 
using Test.java to test)


For programming assignment #2, I created:
- TwoStackQueue.java, Problem2.java
- MyStack.java is the same as for Programming #1
- MyQueue.java is the interface provided in the HW to implement

To test #2, compile the programs from the command line
and then run with the java command:
- javac Problem2.java (compiles Problem2, 
TwoStackQueue, MyStack, and MyQueue)
- java Problem2 (compare to expected output shown 
in Problem2 comments)
