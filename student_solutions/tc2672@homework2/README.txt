Compilation Procedure: 

	Problem 1:
	To compile TwoStackQueue.java: javac SymbolBalance.java 
	To run: java SymbolBalance [Test file name]


	Problem 2: 
	To compile TwoStackQueue.java: javac TwoStackQueue.java
	To compile the test file Program2: javac Program2.java

For the MyStack class, I did not use java.util.Linkedlist as an instance variable. I modeled my MyStack class after the stack example on page 726 of the Big Java textbook.
