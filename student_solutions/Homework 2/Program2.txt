This file contains a discussion of the Big-O runtimes of the enqueue and dequeue
operations of the TwoStackQueue.java file.

ENQUEUE METHOD
---------------

The enqueue method takes a data point as input and pushes it into the 
enqueueStack. The push operation in the stack class too exhibits O(1) runtime.
This is because the push method adds the data point to the end of a linked list.

Insertions at the end of a linked list have O(1) runtime. As a result, the 
entire method of enqueue will have a Big-O of O(1) as well.

DEUQUEUE METHOD
----------------

In the best case, the dequeue method just pops the top element from the 
dequeueStack. This is a O(1) operation as deleting an element from the end of a
doubly linked list is also an order 1 operation. Therefore, this would be the 
best case.

However, in the worst case (hen the dequeueStack is empty), all the data 
currently present in the enqueueStack needs to be transferred to the 
dequeueStack. This involves popping the top element of the enqueueStack and 
pushing it onto dequeueStack. This itself is O(1). However, this needs to be 
performed n times, where n is the size of the enqueueStack. Therefore, the in 
the worst case, the time complexity of the dequeue method is O(n).

The average time complexity, however is just O(1). This is because for every 
dequeue call an average of 1 data point must be shifted from the enqueueStack to
the dequeueStack.
