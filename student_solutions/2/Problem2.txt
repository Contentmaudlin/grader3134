Problem 2 running time question

for the enqueue, the running time is O(1). This is because we are only adding 1 item to the beginning of the queue, which in reality is adding 1 item to the beginning of the stack, which is adding 1 item to the beginning of a doubly linked list, of which adding in either end is O(1). 

for the dequeue, there are two operations being done, both pop() and push(), both of which are O(1),since they are dealing with the first element of a doubly linked list. However, these operations are being done N times as the s1 elements are transfered to s2, and then N-1 times as s2 elements are transferred back to s1. This means that the running time is O(N) since these two instances are added, not multiplied.
