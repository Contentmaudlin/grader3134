All of the code from this directory can be compiled from the command line as such:

javac filename.java

and then run from the command line:

java filename

The file SymbolBalance.java reads lines from a file and returns if any symbols are mismatched. After being complied as usual, it should be run with a specific file as such:

java SymbolBalance MyFile.java

It will then read lines from MyFile.java.


Files relevant to programming question 1:
MyStack.java - impelemnts my MyStack class
SymbolBalance.java - balances the symbols from a file
Test.java - run Symbolbalance with this file to demonstrate symbol balancing capabilities

Files relevant to programming question 2:
MyQueue.java - the interface we were asked to implement
TwoStackQueue.java - my TwoStackQueue class
Program2.java - run Program2 to demonstrate TwoStackQueue
Program2.txt - discusses runtime for TwoStackQueue enqueue and dequeue operations

Also includes written.txt with written question answers.
