The enqueue operation is a simple two step process where one step pushes the item onto the first stack and the other moves the marker for the back of the queue back one. This gives it a constant Big O of N.\
\
The dequeue operation works a little differently. If the second stack is empty then in order to get the bottom of stack one over to the top of stack two each element in stack one has to be \'93popped\'94 over to the second stack for the first element to be dequeued. This means that if the worst case scenario where N elements are in stack one of the queue and none are in the second. Then N operations must be done to get all of those elements over to the second stack before a single one is dequeued. However the advantage of this is that those N elements are already set to be dequeued after that so it only takes 2N operations to dequeue N elements in the worst case scenario. Thus the Big O for the dequeue operation is also N.}
