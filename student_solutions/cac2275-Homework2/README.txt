To run my SymbolBalance just type in "java SymbolBalance Test.java" into the command line.
It takes in the file from the command line. For my Symbol Balance to work the files that should
be compiled are MyStack.java prior to compiling SymbolBalance.java

To see my TwoStackQueue program you need to compile my files TwoStackQueue.java, Program2.java, 
MyStack.java, and the MyQueue.java. Then once those are compiled you must run Program 2 by just
typing in "java Program2"

My main issue has to do with the SymbolBalance program. I represent the /* and */ as <> so
when it runs into a balancing error that includes these characters, it outputs these <>.

My SymbolBalance program does not work perfectly, for starters it doesn't ignore comment lines, so
it reads the whole file, even what's inside the comment lines. I know we were supposed to take that
into consideration, but I did not realize until about an hour before the due date that I forgot to
implement this and it would have drastically affected my program. 

I looked up a lot of methods and things to do on stackoverflow, and i found how to write a stack
class from the Big Java Early Objects textbook.
