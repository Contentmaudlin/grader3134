In a file called Program2.txt, discuss the big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operation for your queue implementation.

	public void enqueue(AnyType x) {
		S1.push(x);
		size++;
	}
	
Big-O running time is a constant for pushes. It is also a constant for the operation size++. So the enqueue operation will measure at O(1).


	public AnyType dequeue(){
		if (S2.isEmpty()) {
			while (!S1.isEmpty()) {
				AnyType x = S1.pop();
				S2.push(x); //S2 takes as input S1's values
			}
		} 
		size --;
		return S2.pop();	
	}

The worst case scenario for dequeue is:
- the running of the first if loop. O(1)
- the running of the first while loop, the worst case scenario for that being that all of S1 is full. O(n)
- the pop operation. O(1)
- the push operation. O(1)
- the decrementing of size. O(1)
- the returning of s2.pop(). O(1)

Overall, this means dequeue is of order O(n).
