This is the ReadMe for Homework 2. 

1. MyStack 
My stack builds a list using LinkedList and creates the pop and push methods using remove and add. And also checks to see if the list is empty. 



2. SymbolBalance

This checks to see if the file is balanced or if it returns an error. If it is not balanced, the unbalanced symbol will be printed.


2. TwoStackQueue & Program 2

Here we built a queue out of two completely separate Generic stacks, stack1 and stack2. We created an enqueue method that pushed the data on to stack 1. The dequeue method pops from stack 1 and pushes into stack 2.

Program2 is essentially a tester for TwoStackQueue. To test the program I enqueueing a number of objects and then dequeueing and printing them in the correct order. By enqueueing 1 through 5 and then dequeueing the program should print numbers 1 through 5. 


To Run:
First unzip the files. Compile all files in the folder as well except for Test. Then to run the first programming assignment (which is symbol balance) type in javac SymbolBalance.java. Then run java SymbolBalance Test.java to test the Symbol Balance. For the second program run java Program2 to test.
