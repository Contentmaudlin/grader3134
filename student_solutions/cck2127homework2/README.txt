How to Run 
**********

Enter javac and the title of the file you want to compile the code. After, simply type java and the title of the file without the extension to run the code. In order to run SymbolBalance.java, you must have a file to input as a command line argument, for instance, Test.java. To do so, when running the code, simple write the name of the file after the name of the class.
