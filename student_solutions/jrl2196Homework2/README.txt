Data Structures Assignment 2


FILES SUBMITTED: 

writtenAssignment2.txt - This is the written portion of the assignment in PDF format. I typed up and compiled 
							this document in LaTeX. 

SymbolBalance.java - This is part one of the programming assignment. This file requires the MyStack.java class 
						in order to work. 
compilation instructions: javac SymbolBalance.java
runtime instructions: java SymbolBalance Test.java

MyStack.java - This is the stack class that I implemented using a LinkedList so that I could use a stack in the 
				SymbolBalance problem as well as the TwoStackQueue problem. 
compilation instructions: javac MyStack.java

Test.java - This is just the file that SymbolBalance uses as a test to see if it can detect errors in a real file.

TwoStackQueue.java - This is the main file for part two of the programming assignment. This is a queue implemented
						using two stacks. You will need the MyStack class and the MyQueue interface to run this.
compilation instructions: javac TwoStackQueue.java

MyQueue.java - This is the interface provided to us to implement for part two of the programming assignment
compilation instructions: javac MyQueue.java

Program2.java - This is the file used to test the TwoStackQueue with some sample pushes and pops
compilation instructions: javac Program2.java
runtime instructions: java Program2

Program2.txt - This is the written analysis of the big-Oh runtime for the routines implemented for the
				TwoStackQueue.
