Problem 2 - Runtime Analysis

Both enqueue and dequeue have a runtime of O(n) where n is the size of the queue. In both methods, in the worst case scenario, every element has to be transferred from one stack to the other. Both push and pop have a runtime of O(1), so the only runtime influence comes from the while loops.
