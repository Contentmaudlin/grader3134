For the TwoStackQueue class, enqueue runs in O(1) time because it simply pushes an object
to the top of stack1 and does not rely on the size of either stack.

The dequeue method runs in O(n) time because every time it is called, it must move every
item from stack1 to stack2 and then back. It runs in 2n time where n is the number of
entries in the queue, but big-Ohdisregards constants so the time complexity remains O(n).
