Programming Problem 2, Part 3

Big-O of Enqueue Method
    The Enqueue Method calls on the push method of MyStack so that will be analyzed. 
    The push method of MyStack calls on LinkedList's add method. 
    Because this has to iterate through every element in the Stack already added, this algorithm is O(N). 

Big-O of Dequeue Method
    The Dequeue Method calls a while loop to iterate through Stack S1 and transfer them to Stack S2.
    Because it iterates through every element, it has cost O(N). 
    The "pop" method called by the Dequeue Method does not affect the cost because it is O(1).
